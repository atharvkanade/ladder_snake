# Snakes and Ladders Game

## Project Description
This Python code implements the classic game of **Snakes and Ladders**. Players take turns rolling a die, moving their piece on a virtual board, and potentially encountering **snakes** (that send them backward) or **ladders** (that propel them forward). The first player to reach position **100** wins the game.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1 - Initialization
- Define the positions of **snakes** and **ladders**.  
- Set the player's position to **0**.

### Phase 2 - Game Loop
- Define the `play_game` method.  
- Roll the dice and move the player.  
- Update the game state and print the current position.

### Phase 3 - Player Movement
- Define the `move_player` method.  
- Roll the dice and print the result.

### Phase 4 - Winning Condition
- Check if the player has reached position **100**.  
- Display a congratulatory message.

### Phase 5 - Execution
- Create an instance of the `SnakesAndLadders` class.  
- Call the `play_game` method to start the game.

## Steps to Run
1. Save the Python code to a file named `Snake_and_ladder.py`.  
2. Run the code using the following command:  
   ```bash
   python Snake_and_ladder.py

## Future Scope

1. **Multiplayer Capability**  
   Implement multiplayer functionality, allowing multiple players to play together, either online or offline.

2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Opponent**  
   Develop an AI opponent that can play against the user, using algorithms like Minimax or Alpha-Beta Pruning.

3. **Real-Time Chat or Voice Communication**  
   Add real-time chat or voice communication capabilities to enable players to interact with each other during gameplay.
