# ladder_snake 

Project Description :- 
                     This Python code implements the classic game of Snakes and Ladders. Players take turns rolling a die, moving their piece on a virtual board, and potentially encountering snakes (that send 
                     them backward) or ladders (that propel them forward). The first player to reach position 100 wins the game.
